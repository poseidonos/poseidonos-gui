***

## Known Issue
* None.

***

## Pre Requirement
#### iBoFOS
* The iBoFOS should be installed

#### M-Tool
* D-Agent uses the same user DB as M-Tool. Therefore, the M-Tool (or mongodb) should be installed. 

#### Config File
* config.yaml file should be in the same location as the executable file.
If there is no config file, d-agent will use default values.
```yaml
server:
  dagent:
    ip: 127.0.0.1
    port: 3000
  ibof:
    ip: 127.0.0.1
    port: 18716
  bmc:
    ip: 192.168.0.2
    port: 443
```

#### Patient & Coffee
* This app is still in progress, so it can be died without any notice.

        |-- run_test.sh

- It contains a simple command like below.

```
$newman run test/sample_test.json -e Test.postman_environment.json -r junit --reporter-junit-export ./result.xml
```

- You have to prepare collection and environment file which are exported from Postman.
